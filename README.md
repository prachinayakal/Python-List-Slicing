# Python List Slicing

This script demonstrates the concept of list slicing in Python, allowing you to extract specific parts of a list by specifying start and end indices.

## Code Overview

The example code defines a list of numbers and uses slicing to retrieve a subset of elements within a specified range.

### Example Code
```python
# Define a list of numbers
num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 33, 34, 56, 43, 67]

# Slice the list to get a portion of it
sliced_number = num[-8:-2]

# Output the original and sliced lists
print("Original list number: ", num)
print("Sliced list number : ", sliced_number)
# Python-List-Slicing
List slicing in Python allows you to access specific portions of a list by specifying a range of indices. This technique is useful for retrieving subsets of data from a larger list
